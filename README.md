**Abstract:**   
Mitochondria play a central role in cellular energetic metabolism. The
essential parts of this metabolism are the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the
respiratory chain and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis machinery.
Here a simplified model of these three metabolic components with a limited set
of differential equations is presented. The existence of a steady state is
demonstrated and results of numerical simulations are presented. The relevance
of a simple model to represent actual in vivo behavior is discussed.
